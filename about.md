Hi, my name is Karan Govil and welcome to my blog.
    
I started this blog as an outlet for technical and programming related posts. I write about functional programming (Haskell), C++, compilers, computer architecture, etc., and this is my way to document and share things that I find interesting.

All content on this blog reflects my personal opinions only; writing the posts and the programming explorations accompanying them are done in my free time. I never write on behalf of my employer in this blog.

For questions and comments, please send me an [email](mailto:karangovil@gmail.com). On Twitter I'm [@karan_govil](https://twitter.com/karan_govil).
