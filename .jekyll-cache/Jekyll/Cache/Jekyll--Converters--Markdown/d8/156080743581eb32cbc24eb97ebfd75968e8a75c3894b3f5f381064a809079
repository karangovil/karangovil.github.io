I"Ã<p>Hi, my name is Karan Govil and welcome to my blog.</p>

<p>I started this blog as an outlet for technical and programming related posts. I write about functional programming (Haskell), C++, compilers, computer architecture, etc., and this is my way to document and share things that I find interesting.</p>

<p>All content on this blog reflects my personal opinions only; writing the posts and the programming explorations accompanying them are done in my free time. I never write on behalf of my employer in this blog.</p>

<p>For questions and comments, please send me an <a href="mailto:karangovil@gmail.com">email</a>. On Twitter Iâ€™m <a href="https://twitter.com/karan_govil">@karan_govil</a>.</p>
