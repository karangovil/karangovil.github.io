I"f<p>This is the first post in a series about a tiny C compiler <code class="highlighter-rouge">hcc</code> (Haskell C Compiler) written in Haskell. A few months ago, I read Abdulaziz Ghuloum’s <a href="http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf">paper</a> on writing an incrmental compiler in Scheme where he implements a small subset of a source language in small steps with the aim of having a “usable” compiler at each step which is capable of compiling small programs. I decided to do this exercise by implmenting a compiler written in Haskell that can compile a “small” subset of C programming language. I debated about using LLVM to generate the backend but decided to instead generate assembly for Intel-x86-64 architecture. This exercise is aimed at learning about compilers, Haskell, assembly and even some corener cases of simple C programs.</p>
