[We Are Legion](https://www.amazon.com/We-Are-Legion-Bob-Bobiverse/dp/B01L082SCI/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=we+are+bob&qid=1581281437&sr=8-1) 
is the first book of three in the Bobiverse trilogy written by Dennis E. Taylor. The audible version is narrated by Ray Porter (one of my
favorite audiobooks narrators) and it was named Audible's Best Science Fiction Book of 2016. This was my second time listening to it and I
absolutely love this book (it feels like a bit of a guilty pleasure after reading a sci-fi classic such as Hyperion).

We Are Legion is the story of a software entrepreneur, Bob, who signs a contract with a cryogenics company to preserve his body and brain after his death. He wakes up about
a hundred years later to find a completely different Earth and the trilogy chronicles his journey through the universe. The books are a far
cry from hard science fiction but are very easy to read and quite relatable to me since the author is a retired programmer. However, it is
really Ray Porter's narration that makes this such a treat and I enjoy listening to whenever I can squeeze time (even 5 mins).

This book doesn't take itself very seriously, has plenty of pop sci-fi references to keep things light and the science is generally well
thought. The audiobook is only slightly over nine hours so it was a quick listen and easily finished in a week. I greatly enjoyed it the
first time and really looking forward to listening to the next two books!
