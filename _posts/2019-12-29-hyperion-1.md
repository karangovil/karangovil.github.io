[Hyperion](https://www.amazon.com/Hyperion-Cantos-Book-1-ebook/dp/B004G60EHS/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=hyperion&qid=1577655647&sr=8-3) 
is the first book in the Hyperion Cantos saga written by Dan Simmons.It won the 1990 Hugo award for the best novel.

Hyperion is set in a world where humanity has colonized beyond Earth (in fact, Old Earth no longer exists). It starts on the eve of an
intergalactic war with a group of seven characters making a pilgrimage to the mysterious planet known as Hyperion. During this pilgrimage, 
each of them tells their story of how they are connected to Hyperion. In fact, the book ends right when all the stories are told and it has a sort 
of an open ending which might upset some readers. However, the second book, Fall of Hyperion, is supposed to be read in continuity and 
promises to give a more satifying ending.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading Hyperion on my Kindle (and listening the audiobook for last couple of stories during a drive). Dan Simmons' world
building is quite exquisite and I was really placed in the mysterious world of Hyperion without even understanding the exact meaning 
of some of the sci-fi concepts that are often just thrown around without much explanation. In particular, I found Father Lenoyt's and Sol 
Weintraub's stories to be quite moving. There is a lot of poetry by Keats, some philosophy and discussion of Catholicism in these futuristic
world. I am looking to forward to reading the next book!
