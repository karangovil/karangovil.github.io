[The Fall of Hyperion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_Hyperion_(novel)) 
is the second book in the Hyperion Cantos saga written by Dan Simmons.It was nominated for the Hugo award and the Nebula award.

The Fall of Hyperion is a direct sequel to Hyperion and picks up right after the events of Hyperion. The pilgrims have told their stories and
must face the Shrike creature. This book is similar in length to the prequel but feels much more fast paced. The Ouster invasion begins and
we see everything through the eyes of Joseph Severn. There are many references to John Keats and a fair amount of poetry (with a couple by 
Yeats as well). We are introduced to numerous characters including Meina Gladstone and various aspects of TechnoCore. The ending was a bit 
convoluted but I really enjoyed it. It really did justice to over a thousand pages of prequel and sequel and felt quite satisfactory.

I greatly enjoyed reading both the Hyperion books on my Kindle. I did listen to parts of the book on audio, however, I reserve that for when 
I am driving and I am behind my reading goals. Otherwise I really preferred just reading the Hyperion books. The description of TechnoCore
was interesting, if a bit confusing. I am still very much an amateur (or rather even less than that) when it comes to poetry and Keats is 
really not for the light hearted. I especially liked the treatment of Catholic Church through Father Paul Dur√©. I am going to take a break 
from long books but I look forward to reading the Endymion books in Hyperion Cantos soon!
